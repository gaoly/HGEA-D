# A new history-guided multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition for batching scheduling (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2019.112920)

A history-guided evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with two strategies is proposed to solve a multi-objective scheduling problem on parallel batching machines.

## How to Run
1.Configure JobNum and MNum to be (300,5) or (150,3) in "Common.h"
2.Run the main function
3.Get experimental results in the in "./result"
